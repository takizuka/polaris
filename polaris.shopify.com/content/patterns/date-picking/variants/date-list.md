## How it helps merchants

![](/images/patterns/date-list-cover-image.png)

1. The date list provides merchants with suggested dates. This makes date picking simpler when useful dates are predictable and custom dates aren’t necessary.

<div as="DefinitionTable">

### Use when merchants need to:

**Select from templated dates**
: When a templated list of dates is sufficient for the merchant task, use the date list because it is a task that does not require in-depth filtering of historical information. Found in: Inbox app / Overview

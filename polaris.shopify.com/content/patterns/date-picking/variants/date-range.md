## How it helps merchants

![](/images/patterns/date-range-cover-image.png)

1. Providing multiple ways to select a date range gives merchants full flexibility. The list provides quick access to common options, the text input makes it easier to set large custom ranges, and the calendar is an intuitive way to set a more narrow scope.
2. Displaying two months makes it easier for merchants to select date ranges that span across both.
3. Selecting a date range may require multiple steps, so merchants prefer to explicitly confirm their selection, unlike the single date picker which closes on selection.

### Use when merchants need to:

**Analyze trends and data**
: When a merchant needs to view their business metrics so that they can learn and make decisions, they use the date range picker to frame data to certain time periods. Found in: Analytics

**Schedule an event**
: When a merchant needs to schedule an event that spans multiple days, a date range picker is necessary.
